beyond the horizon there is a vale of gloom

your first volume of poetry will be published as soon as you finish it

you will mee a beautiful tall blonde stranger and you will not say hello

you will take a long trip and you will be very happy, though alone

in order to understand yourself, you must first destroy yourself

i think you're wonderful and so does everyone else

you are a prisoner in a croissant factory, and you love it

a lot of people in this room wish they were you

that's not a run in your stocking, it's a hand on your leg

please disregard previous cookie

you are going to make a very lucky girl very sad one day

you were alone before they left you

do not hit send

there's someone special out there for everyone. you'll never meet them, but they are there

life is like a box of bullshit

no one cares. seriously. look it up

good things come to those who wait and sometimes not at all or ever

life is what happens when you wait for his text

you've been pre-qualified to make it weird

if you love something, it's totally your fault

all you need is a few more strangers telling you you're beautiful, and you'll be right as rain

he's not thinking about you so think about what you eat

prank your future self by wasting your life

who ever falls in love first loses

percieve everything as a rejection just to be safe

wishing things away is not effective

you won't be anyone besides you for the rest of your life

fashion tip: nobody cares

you look stupid in pictures and that's why no one lifes you

Simon says lower your expectations

if you're struggling in life, it's important to remember nobody cares

the stuff that scares you probably won't happen but other bad stuff definitely will

count to infinity and then text him

if you are afraid of lonliness don't get married

for a good time don't call

you shouldn't have to go through this alone, but you will

if you ove someone, let them nap

you miss 100% of the naps you don't take

nothing is the only thing that can save you now

have you tried dwelling on it forever

how to tell someone you love them: Don't

horoscope: don't get too excited

you were wrong about yourself

everything's depressing if you live long enough

horoscope: she's lying

with a little luck, you'll never fall in love again

every day is take your drugs to work day

every day one more person forgets about you

no one wants to make a sandwhich with your balogna

the problem is you

pain is everywhere and the world is terrifying

from now on, every song is about you

horoscope: like yesterday but a little bit worse

aren't you supposed to be dead?

something is terribly wrong and you don't know what it is

fuck the consequences

nothing significant happens until a pattern is broken

Pro Tip: do not get out of bed

you will fall in love with strangers on the internet

you are not okay, do not tell anyone

your life is a show about nothing

you do not exist

might as well be who you are

the secret to your future is hidden in your daily routine

if you wait until your ready, you'll be waiting the rest of your life

the past is a foreign country, and they do things differently there

you will always admire what you do not understand

there is safety in nothing

ease into your irrelevance

they don't like you as much as you like them

hey you sexy piece of shit

you would rather die than face the truth

that which is possible is inevitable

don't expect them to forgive you

there's no more room for improvement
